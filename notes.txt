## Notes
- de novo binder generation
    - [masif](https://github.com/LPDI-EPFL/masif)  
        - geometric deep learning on protein surfaces for predicting a binding site on a single protein
        - used for finding where to bind 
    - [p2rank](https://github.com/rdk/p2rank)
        - ML-based ligand binding site predictor (designed for small molecules)
        - predicts pockets likely to bind to molecules 
        - used for designing around pockets

        - structure based de novo binder generation
        - put in a target + optional constraints, and it generates the binder 
        - doesn't need binding site if scaffolded correctly 
- tar -xvjs: "unpack this .tar.bz2 file and show me the progress"
- scons: python based build system, like Make files but for Python
    - allows the user to specify the number of jobs they can do
    - a job = one CPU thread
- hyperthreaded: one physical CPU core runs two instruction streams (threads) at once by sharing core resources
    - boosts performance 10-30%
